This is a two-stage process. The first wave of three proposals allows us to better define with the customer the message and image that the company needs to convey. After selecting a lead and refining the direction to be taken, the second wave of proposals is made. In this project, in the first wave, we were able to discard proposal no. 1 because it was more suggestive of luxury codes, which is not WoodYou's target. We also discarded proposal no. 2 because it only targeted the playful world of toys, where WoodYou wanted to reach beyond that."

The bear was chosen to evoke nature and the forest in a more mature way than other small animals usually associated with childhood, and because it reflects the values of the company's founders: boldness, strength and determination. It was proposal no. 1 of the second wave that was chosen by the client, for its balance of elementary modular forms, retaining the Tangram reference."
