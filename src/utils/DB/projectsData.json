        "description": "This is the logotype creation process for WoodYou, a company whose main activity is the creation of made-to-measure laser-cut wooden objects for toys, decoration and communication media. This is a two-stage process. The first wave of three proposals allows us to better define with the customer the message and image that the company needs to convey. After selecting a lead and refining the direction to be taken, the second wave of proposals is made. In this project, in the first wave, we were able to discard proposal no. 1 because it was more suggestive of luxury codes, which is not WoodYou's target. We also discarded proposal no. 2 because it only targeted the playful world of toys, where WoodYou wanted to reach beyond that."

        "description": "Proposal no. 3 was chosen as the basis for the rest of the project, because it evoked both playfulness, with its reference to the \"Tangram\" silhouette game, and tailor-made modularity, while at the same time benefiting from the appeal of a mascot animal. The bear was chosen to evoke nature and the forest in a more mature way than other small animals usually associated with childhood, and because it reflects the values of the company's founders: boldness, strength and determination. It was proposal no. 1 of the second wave that was chosen by the client, for its balance of elementary modular forms, retaining the Tangram reference."
